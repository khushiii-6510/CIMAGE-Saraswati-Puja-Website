        (January-February). It coincides with Vasant Panchami
        or Shree Panchami. People place books near the goddess' 
        statue or picture and worship the goddess. Many choose

        (Hate Khori) by children. The goddess Saraswati is often depicted as
        a beautiful woman dressed in pure white,often seated on a white 
        lotus, white symbolizes light, knowledge, and truth.
